# Driver Distraction Detection - Android App

Welcome to **Driver Distraction Detection**! This Android app is designed to detect distractions while driving by monitoring phone usage and using acoustic signals to determine the type of material the phone is placed on. The app aims to reduce road accidents by providing real-time feedback to drivers when distractions are detected.

## üöó Key Features
- **Phone Usage Detection**: The app tracks when the phone is being used during driving, such as texting, calling, or browsing apps. It will notify the driver if any usage is detected during driving.
- **Acoustic Signal Analysis**: The app uses acoustic signals to detect the type of material the phone is placed on (e.g., seat, dashboard, or other surfaces). This helps in identifying if the phone is likely being used while driving or if it is safely stored.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Whenever a distraction is detected (whether from phone usage or acoustic signals), the app sends real-time notifications to alert the driver.
- **Background Monitoring**: The app continuously monitors phone usage and acoustic signals in the background while the driver is on the road.
- **Distraction Logs**: Track and view logs of detected distractions to help users monitor their driving habits.

## üì± Platform
- **Android (Mobile)**: This app is designed for Android smartphones, compatible with Android versions 6.0 (API 23) and above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Acoustic Signal Processing**: Audio API for capturing and processing acoustic signals
- **Phone Usage Detection**: UsageStatsManager API to track app usage during driving
- **Background Services**: Services to monitor phone usage and acoustic signals in the background
- **UI**: Android UI components for displaying notifications and logs

## üìë App Flow

1. **Launch Screen**: Upon launching the app, it asks for necessary permissions (phone usage access, microphone access for acoustic signal detection).
2. **Monitoring Screen**: Once permissions are granted, the app continuously monitors phone usage and acoustic signals while driving.
3. **Distraction Detection**: The app detects if the phone is being used (e.g., sending a text or making a call) or if the acoustic signal suggests that the phone is placed on a distraction-prone surface.
4. **Notifications**: If a distraction is detected, the app sends real-time notifications to the driver, urging them to focus on the road.
5. **Log Screen**: View a log of past distractions, including the type of distraction and when it occurred.
